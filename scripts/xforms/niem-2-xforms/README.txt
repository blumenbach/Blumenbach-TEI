This folder contains a sample transform from a NIEM constraint XML Schema file to an XForms application.

The sample inputs are in the schemas directory.

The sample outputs are in the XForms directory.

The main niem-2-xforms.xsl transform is in the xslt directory.

A sample Apache Ant build file is also available for those that do not have XMLSpy.  You will need to download the saxon jar files and change the path in the build file to get the build file to work.

The NIEM-2-XForms.spp file is an Altova XMLSpy project file.  Just click on the input XML Schemas an select the "transform" menu to convert the XML Schemas into XForms.

Note that the transforms will require a XSLT 2.0 processor such as Saxon.

Good Luck and Happy Transforming!
