* View and Transform Form Data
* Publish Transformed Data into Collection

These interfaces are described in [Using XForms](../xforms/xforms-usage)

* Authentication as a _dba_ is required to use these tools.

For all eXist-db related administration, the tools are accessible through the [Dashboard]( /exist/apps/dashboard/index.html)

* Tools available from the Dashboard are:
    * Package Manager
    * Monitoring and Profiling
    * Collections
    * Backup
    * User Manager
