### Blumenbach TEI Datenbank

* The Blumenbach TEI Datenbank provides a solid foundation towards the synthesis of disparate data sets.
* The Blumenbach TEI Datenbank leverages the latest developments in XML technology and provides a very flexible and robust information service.
    * It is built on the eXist native XML database and exploits [XRX architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XRX_(web_application_architecture)).

The Blumenbach TEI Datenbank aims to serve as a open data source for Bibliographic information on the writings of the German physician, naturalist, physiologist, and anthropologist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach.

Blumenbach was a prolific writer producing more than 80,000 pages of printed text in his lifetime.

He had a wide-range of influence, spanning internationally and across the Atlantic.
